# Assembly-Language
The Assembly Language Learnt


## MARIE Assembly (Simple Database Application)

### Objective:
Develop a MARIE application to manage unit prerequisites information. The application should accept unit codes as input and output their respective prerequisites.

The unit prerequisite that is stored in the MARIE code is as below:
- for FIT2093, the prerequisites are FIT1045 and FIT1047
- for FIT2100, the prerequisite is FIT1047

### Instructions:
1. Utilize any MARIE assembly language supporting application for code execution.
2. Enter unit codes ONE character at a time using Unicode encoding. For example, for the input "FIT2093", enter 'f', 'i', 't', '2', '0', '9', '3' where each comma represents a single input.
3. Terminate input with a DECIMAL 0 to signal the end of the string (NOT Unicode).


### Demo:
A video recording of the application demonstration is attached.
